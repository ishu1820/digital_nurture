Q1. Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.
ANSWER.
CONCEPT OF RECURSION: A function that calls itself.
It is used when a function has to be used multiple times.

SIMPLIFY PROBLEMS:
Reduces complex logic by clean and easy code.
Helps where repetitive execution is required.

Q2. Discuss the time complexity of your recursive approach.
ANSWER: Time complexity of my recursive approach is O(N).

Because we are decreasing the years by 1. So if function is called for n years it will make N recursive calls.
